# Maptiles
Introduction:
This is a project where I created `cartogram` map styles from [Mapbox](https://apps.mapbox.com/cartogram/#13.01/40.7251/-74.0051) and then generate map tiles from Qgis Tiles. My map tiles  can be visit [here](https://shuangw1.github.io/maptiles/).

I upload my own image, a cute puppy, to Mapbox cartogram and create the following brown-yellowish map stiles. Then I get into Qgis and generate map tiles following the tutorial found [here](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog458/tree/master/labs/lab04).



Code example:
Here I use relative path to add my map tiles from the assets folder in github repo to LeafLet.
`L.tileLayer('Tiles/index/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: 'Generated by QMetaTiles',
  detectRetina: true
}).addTo(map);`

In order to view the map in the github page, I change `http` to `https` to successfully load the map.
